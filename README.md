# Crius-Vertical-Infinity-Control-v1.0
The Crius “Vertical Infinity Control v1.0” USB MIDI Controller consists of 8 potentiometers with which we can control the parameters of the VST-Plugin or the DAW we play music and 8 RGB LED Rings around the perimeter of each potentiometer  that illuminate and change color depending on the position of the corresponding potentiometer.
